# ðŸ“™ NoteHelpers plugin
This plugin provides commands to do things with notes that aren't yet provided in the app:

- **add number of days to dates**: looks for bullets in your current open note that end with `[[YYYY-MM-DD]]:` and adds the number of days to or since that date. Useful for making lists of important days and easily knowing number of days to (or since) that day.
- **add trigger to note**: makes it easy to add a trigger to a particular note. It lists the functions from all plugins that it can work out are written for triggers, but also allows any function to be picked. (See [NotePlan help page on Triggers](https://help.noteplan.co/article/173-plugin-note-triggers).)
- **convert to frontmatter**: convert the current note to use frontmatter syntax, including optional default text that can be added in the Plugin's settings.
- **enable heading links**: converts Local links to headings (they start with the `#` character) to `x-callback-url` links that makes them work the way you expect them to. Note: They currently only support links to headings within the same note.  (by @nmn)
- **index folders** (alias **index**): make/update indexes for all notes in a folder (and sub-folders if wanted). There are settings available to customise this:
  - Sort order for index items: 'alphabetical', 'createdDate' or 'updatedDate'
  - What type of date suffix to add?: 'none', 'timeSince' last update, 'updatedDate'
  - Include Subfolders when making an index? If set, then all subfolders will be indexed in the same name as the folder.
  - Title to use for Index notes: this can include a placeholder `{{folder}}` or `{{full_folder_path}}` which will be replaced by the folder's name or full path.
- **jump to heading** (alias **jh**): jumps the cursor to the selected heading in the current note. See below for how to use this from a x-callback-url
- **jump to note's heading** (alias **jn**): jump to a different note, and then to the selected heading
- **jump to done** (alias **jd**): simply jumps the cursor to the `## Done` section of the current note (if it exists)
- **move note** (alias **mn**): which moves a note to a different folder the user selects
- **open current note new split** (alias **ocns**): open the current note again in a new split of the main window (and places the cursor at what it judges to be the start of the main content)
- **open note new window** (alias **onw**): open a user-selected note in a new window (and places the cursor at what it judges to be the start of the main content)
- **open note new split** (alias **ons**): open a user-selected note in a new split of the main window (and places the cursor at what it judges to be the start of the main content)
- **open url from a note**: asks for a note, and then presents a list of URLs found in that note. The selected one is then opened in your default browser. (There's a setting to ignore URLs in closed tasks.)
- **rename note filename**: renames the currently open note. Note: this changes the underlying _filename_ not the visible _title_.
- **reset caches**: this simply runs the command of that name in the NotePlan Help menu.
- **Show This Month** (alias /stm)
- **Show This Quarter** (alias /stq)
- **Show This Year** (alias /sty)
- **update all indexes**: updates all the existing folder index notes
- **list inconsistent note filenames**: lists the names of notes whose filenames are inconsistent with their titles
- **rename filename to title**: renames the current filename to the title of the note
- **rename inconsistent note filenames**: renames the files of notes whose filenames are inconsistent with their titles

**Tip**: some of these are even more helpful if you assign a keyboard shortcut to them, using macOS's Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts system. For example I have mapped â‡§âŒ˜H to `/jump to heading`.

(If these commands are useful to you, you'll probably find the [TidyUp plugin](https://github.com/NotePlan/plugins/blob/main/np.Tidy/) helpful too. It's rather arbitrary which commands live in which plugin.)

## Using from x-callback-url calls
You can trigger these commands from [outside NotePlan using the **x-callback-url mechanism**](https://help.noteplan.co/article/49-x-callback-url-scheme#runplugin). This can be used in a template or shortcut, or any other place a URL can be accessed. Every call takes the same form:
```
noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=jgclark.NoteHelpers&command=<encoded command name>
```
As with all x-callback-urls, all the arguments (including the command name) need to be URL encoded. For example, spaces need to be turned into '%20'.  **Tip**: use @dwertheimer's Link Creator Plugin's "/Get x-callback-url" command to do the fiddly work for you.

Additionally the **index folders** and **jump to heading** commands can take arguments, which also need to be encoded. 
```
noteplan://x-callback-url/runPlugin?pluginID=jgclark.NoteHelpers&command=<encoded command name>&arg0=<encoded string>[&arg1=<encoded string>]
```
The arguments are:

| Command | encoded command name | arg0 | arg1 |
|-----|-------------|-----|-----|
| index folders | `...index%20folders&` | folder name | other args as a `key=value;key2=value` string.<br />Possible keys are displayOrder (`alphabetical` (default) or `updatedDate`, `createdDate`),  dateDisplayType (`none` (default) or `timeSince`, `updateDate`), includeSubfolders (`true` or `false`) |
| jump to heading | `...jump%20to%20heading&` | heading to jump to | - |

<!-- Notes:
- the number and order of arguments you pass is important
- where an argument isn't valid (empty in the table below), *you still need to include it*
- as with all x-callback-urls, all the arguments (including the command name) need to be URL encoded. For example, spaces need to be turned into '%20'.  **Tip**: use @dwertheimer's Link Creator Plugin's "/Get x-callback-url" command to do the fiddly work for you.
- it's possible to send one or more empty arguments, and that will cause the missing argument(s) be requested from the user, as it it were run interactively.
